### Limitation
This game has a limited game screen size due to the graphics and the Java Language used in development
### How this game works?
This game allows for designing the game's notes through writing a beat map in text format. The game system can decode the text into game notes with the reading rule that one beat contains five lines and is synchronized with the song's rhythm in each level, which can be customized based on the song's BPM (beats per minute).

You can view examples in the [beatmaps](https://github.com/panutTea/Kitap/tree/main/beatmaps) folder and compare them within the game.
